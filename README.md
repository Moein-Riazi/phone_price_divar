This is a just for fun program:) As I mentioned this program is just for fun and this is not clean code, so if you are here and see this don't panic :)

1.You need to start the "starter.sh" for the first time. so type "./starter.sh"

2.Open your browser and enter this URL: http://localhost:8594

3.If you want to change the config only run starter again.

4.If you need to update database of price and phones only execute "./starter -p" **-p is option that acts as permanent

5.If you want to see all URLs that fit your budget only execute "./starter -v" and enter your budget. ;)
